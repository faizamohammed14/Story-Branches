# Tales in Branches
## Chapter 1: The First Commit  
In the beginning, there was only an empty repository.  
A lone developer created the very first file, marking the **root commit**.  
It was small, but it was the foundation upon which the entire project would grow. 

##Chapter 2: The First Branch
In time, the project outgrew its single line of history.
A new branch was created, diverging from the main flow.
On this branch, the story unfolded with new ideas and changes, isolated yet connected to the root.
It was the beginning of parallel development â€” where experiments could live safely without disturbing the foundation.
